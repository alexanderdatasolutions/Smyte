# Smyte Resource Economy - Philosophy & Player Archetypes

## Vision
**"I want to feel cool going for certain things I need."**

The resource economy in Smyte is designed to support **multiple playstyles** without forcing everyone down the same path. Whether you're a dedicated fisher, a PvP warmonger, a crafting tycoon, or an AFK optimizer - the game respects your choice and makes it **feel rewarding**.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Purpose-Driven Resources
**Every resource has clear, meaningful uses**

❌ **BAD**: "Here's 50 different gems. They all do... something?"
✅ **GOOD**: "I need mythril ore → craft epic weapons → dominate arena → climb PvP ranks"

#### Resource → Purpose Mapping:

| Resource Category | Primary Purpose | Why Players Want It |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Mine Resources** (ores, gems) | Equipment crafting, gem socketing | Get stronger weapons/armor for combat |
| **Forest Resources** (wood, herbs, fiber) | Equipment crafting, enhancement | Craft armor, upgrade equipment safely |
| **Coast Resources** (fish, pearls, salt) | Trading, gemstones, consumables | Sell for gold, socket pearls, buff food |
| **Hunting Resources** (pelts, bones, scales) | Leather/bone armor, monster gear | Craft specialized hunting/PvP gear |
| **Forge Resources** (ingots, flames, powders) | Advanced crafting, enhancement | Unlock epic+ recipes, upgrade equipment |
| **Temple Resources** (divine essence, mana) | God awakening, magic items | Power up your gods, unlock abilities |
| **Library Resources** (research, scrolls) | Recipe unlocking, god training | Discover new recipes, train god skills faster |

### 2. Specialization = Mastery
**Going deep feels better than spreading thin**

Players who **commit to a specialization** get:
- **2-3x resource gathering efficiency** (from spec bonuses)
- **Access to higher tier nodes** (unlock gates)
- **Unique passive bonuses** (Tier 3 specs have auras)
- **Trading power** (you have what others need)

**Example**:
- **Tier 1 Miner** → +50% ore yield, unlocks Tier 2 mines
- **Tier 2 Deep Miner** → +100% ore yield, unlocks mythril mining
- **Tier 3 Earth Shaper** → +200% ore yield, can mine divine ore, +20% production to ALL connected nodes

**Feels cool because**: You're not just "better at mining" - you're a **legendary miner who shapes the earth itself**.

### 3. Player Choice Architecture
**The game doesn't force a "meta" path**

You can succeed by focusing on:
- **Combat** (arena, raids, territory conquest)
- **Crafting** (supply the server with gear)
- **Gathering** (supply crafters with materials)
- **Trading** (buy low, sell high, control markets)
- **AFK Optimization** (maximize offline gains, strategic node placement)
- **PvP Raiding** (steal resources, contest territory)

Each path **feeds into** other paths without requiring you to do everything.

## The Trading Economy

### Why Resources Have Value
Every resource is **fungible** (tradeable) because:
1. **Different players need different things** (PvP player needs ore, crafter needs herbs)
2. **Specialization creates supply/demand** (miners have excess ore, need enhancement powder)
3. **Node scarcity** (only limited Tier 3+ nodes exist)

### Trading Examples:
- **Fisher** trades fish → **Crafter** for equipment
- **Miner** trades ore → **Alchemist** for enhancement powder
- **Raider** steals resources → **Trader** sells for profit
- **Scholar** unlocks recipe → **Crafter** pays to learn it

### Market Dynamics:
- **Early game**: Basic materials abundant (iron, wood, herbs)
- **Mid game**: Tier 2 materials drive economy (mythril, rare herbs, steel)
- **Late game**: Tier 3+ materials are premium (forging flame, divine essence, awakening stones)
- **Endgame**: Mythic crafting materials control server economy

## AFK Optimization Strategies

### Production Formula:
```
Total Production = Base × (1 + Upgrade) × (1 + Connected) × (1 + Worker) × (1 + Spec)
```

### Max AFK Gains:
1. **Base Production** - Capture high-tier nodes (Tier 3 = 3x Tier 1)
2. **Upgrade Bonus** - Max out production levels (+100% at level 10)
3. **Connected Bonus** - Place nodes adjacently (+30% for 4+ connected)
4. **Worker Bonus** - Assign gods with matching specs (+200% from Tier 3)
5. **Spec Bonus** - Your specialization adds +50-200%

**Example**:
- **Tier 3 mine** (50 mythril/hour base)
- **+100% upgrade** (level 10 production) = 100 mythril/hour
- **+30% connected** (4 adjacent nodes) = 130 mythril/hour
- **+200% Tier 3 Earth Shaper** spec = 390 mythril/hour
- **+10% per worker** (3 gods assigned) = 507 mythril/hour

**Offline for 12 hours = 6,084 mythril ore** (while you sleep!)

### Strategic Node Placement:
```
   [Temple] - [Mine] - [Forge]
      |         |         |
   [Forest] - [Base] - [Library]
      |         |         |
   [Coast] - [Hunt] - [Mine]
```
- **8 connected nodes** = +30% production each
- **Production chain** = mine feeds forge, forge uses forest powder
- **Distance optimized** = all within 1-2 hexes of base (minimal distance penalty)
