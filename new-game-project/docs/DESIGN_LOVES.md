# Game Design Loves & Preferences

*An ongoing list of what makes the game feel right*

---

## Core Philosophies

### Time = Power
- Rewarding time investment is fundamental
- Players who put in hours should feel meaningfully stronger
- Simple to learn, but depth rewards dedication

### Everything Connects
- Systems should interweave (grind Zone A → get Blacksmithing mats → craft gear → unlock Zone B)
- No isolated systems - cooking, crafting, combat, gathering all feed into each other
- Progression in one area enables progression in others

### Set It & Forget It (Idle/AFK Mechanics)
- Able to leave the game running for 1-2 hours
- Watch progress happen while working
- Wake up to "giga gains"
- Auto-mining, auto-grinding, auto-processing
- The satisfaction of coming back to accumulated rewards

---

## Progression Systems

### Specializations & Depth
- **Reward going DEEP** in a specialization
- Subclasses and branching paths
- The more you commit, the more you unlock
- Specialists should feel distinct and powerful in their niche

### Tiered Units & Evolutions
- Ascended/awakened systems ✓ (already have this)
- Pokemon-style evolutions
- Clear visual/power progression through tiers
- "Scratches the itch" of upgrading and evolving

### Skills & Connections
- Tons of skills to unlock
- Skill trees with meaningful branching
- Skills that synergize with each other
- Connections between different skill paths

---

## Social & Competition

### Competing with Friends
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Being able to compare progress
- The thrill of being ahead (or catching up)
- Bragging rights matter

### RNG & Gacha Elements
- The excitement of RNG boxes
- Getting lucky and being "carried" compared to friends
- And vice versa - the motivation when friends get lucky
- Some pay-to-win elements (gotta make money)
- But not excessive - balance is key

---

## Monetization Notes
- Some level of gacha is good
- Pay-to-win elements acceptable but not overwhelming
- Revenue is a goal
